								Space exploration began only 60 years ago and look at where we
								are now! The first man in space was Russian cosmonaut Yuri
								Gagarin. He completed one orbit of the Earth and beat the
								Americans to space by only a few months. Some other famous
								firsts include the first satellite launched into space in 1957.
								The first animal in space was Laika the dog, also in 1957. John
								Glenn was the first American in space in 1962. Neil Armstrong
								was the first man to walk on the Moon in 1969. The first private
								commercial space mission happened in 2012 when SpaceX send an
								unmanned capsule with supplies to the International Space
								Station. Just last year, in 2021, the original captain of Star
								Trek&apos;s Enterprise, William Shatner, became the oldest
								person in space at the age of 90 years old. In 2013, Canadian
								Chris Hadfield created the first music video in space.

								Only 9 Canadians have ever been in space. Marc Garneau was the
								first to go to space in 1984. In 2013, Canadian Col. Chris
								Hadfield joined the crew of the International Space Station. He
								became famous during his mission to space by documenting the
								daily life of an astronaut (such as &quot;how astronauts
								sleep&quot;) using social media and by sharing breathtaking
								photographs on his Twitter account. He also charmed his fans
								with his rendition of David Bowie&apos;s &quot;Space
								Oddity&quot;.
